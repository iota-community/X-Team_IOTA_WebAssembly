## ðŸŒ³ IOTA WebAssembly(Wasm) Initiative

The **IOTA WebAssembly(Wasm) Initiative** is a collaborative effort to discover the usage of Wasm in the IOTA Ecosystem, doing research, creating learning material, test and improve the Wasm binings and create tools and applications for the Wasm and IOTA Community.

[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger technology that allows [connected devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connected_Devices) to transfer data and [IOTA tokens](https://docs.iota.org/docs/getting-started/0.1/clients/token) among each other for zero fees.

## ðŸŽ¯ Initiative Goals

The IOTA WebAssembly(Wasm) Initiative is in phase [alpha implementation, ready for review, research phase]. We are currently focused on improving the IOTA Experience around the following goals:
